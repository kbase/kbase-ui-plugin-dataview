basic strat:

fetch sample set info - already done by the landing page

everything below is cached

fetch sample set object  (get_object2)

fetch all samples in sample set (get_samples)

fetch linked data for each sample 

fetch object info for each unique object and object version 

fetch user profile for each unique user


this establishes the base data.

then we can dynamically (or cache too, but doesn't really matter) generate derived data:

- summary of sample set

- summary by sample and object type
